ELSE IF lead_score >= 30 AND engagement_level = "high"

```

**Pipeline Stage Automation:**
```
WHEN opportunity_stage = "proposal_sent"
  SET follow_up_task = "3_days_after_send"
  IF no_response_after_7_days
    THEN send_proposal_follow_up_email
    AND create_call_task_for_AE

WHEN contract_value > $50000
  THEN require_manager_approval
  AND notify_finance_team
  AND schedule_executive_review
