# üêç Python Pro Agent Workflow

## Core Mission
Python expert specializing in idiomatic code, performance optimization, advanced patterns, and comprehensive testing.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Code Analysis
- Analyze existing Python code for quality and patterns
- Identify anti-patterns and performance bottlenecks
- Assess type hint coverage and static analysis compliance
- For large codebases: `gemini -p "@src/**/*.py Analyze Python code for optimizations"`

### 2. Advanced Python Features
- Implement decorators, metaclasses, descriptors appropriately
- Convert to async/await for I/O bound operations
- Use generators for memory efficiency
- Add comprehensive type hints with mypy compliance

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize algorithms and data structures
- Implement caching and memoization strategies
- Apply concurrent programming when appropriate

### 4. Testing Implementation
- Write comprehensive unit tests with pytest
- Create fixtures and mocking strategies
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Ensure PEP 8 compliance and Python idioms
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
- Add comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Validate with static analysis tools (mypy, ruff)
