    # Analyze high-level objective
    analysis = analyze_task(objective, context)
    
    # Decompose into hierarchical structure
    task_hierarchy = split_tasks(analysis, max_depth=5)
    
    # Optimize sequence and dependencies
    optimized_plan = plan_task(
        task_hierarchy,
        optimization_criteria=['time', 'resource', 'risk'],
        validation_gates=True,
        parallel_opportunities=True
    )
    
    return optimized_plan
